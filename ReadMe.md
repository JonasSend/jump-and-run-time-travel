# Jump and Run POC

## Game Identity
[TBD] is a jump and run game [with time travel?].

## Game Pillar(s)
Make it to the end of the level without dying. Try to be as quick as possible.

## Mechanics
Classic jump and run game: Quickly jump over obstacles, evade enemies[, collect coins?]. If you die, the level starts from the beginning. For now: You see the whole level in one window.

At the push of the CNTRL button, you travel back in time to the start of the level. Your previous actions have been recorded.

## Interface
Idea: Left and right arrows to move with SPACE as jump button. [Press [TBD] to travel back in time to the beginning of the level.]

## Art style
TBD

## Agenda
* Simple level with rectangles as player and obstacles
* Physics (jumping)
* Time travel
* More functionality
* Make it look nice
